//forward
This component Allows you to add an attribute to any page based outcome and then to handle the outcome being selected in java script

You add an attribute to the outcome e.g. MyOutcomeAction and set it to true to have it fire

You then need to create a function to handle the event and register it in the player.

There are two OOB functions for AutoClose and ForcePrint.


Upload the assets
=====================
Upload the js file as an asset in the tenant.
It should be called OutcomeManager.js


Add the custom resources the player
====================
<script>
        
var manywho = {
            
	cdnUrl: 'https://assets.manywho.com',
            
	requires: ['core', 'bootstrap3'],
            
           
            
	customResources: [
            
		'https://s3.amazonaws.com/files-manywho-com/<tenantid>/OutcomeManager.js',            
	],


			
Add custom attributes
=====================
var manywho = {
            
	cdnUrl: 'https://assets.manywho.com',
            
	requires: ['core', 'bootstrap3'],
            
           
            
	customResources: [
            
		'https://s3.amazonaws.com/files-manywho-com/<tenantid>/OutcomeManager.js',            
	],
	 OutcomeHandlers: {
        		
		"banana": window["bananaHandler"], 
        	
	},

Note these need to go immediatly after the customResources declaration as shown.

It's an associative array with the key being the outcome attribute name (case sensitive) and the value is the the function which handles the call. We pass the actual function.


Implement the functions
=======================

In the player code add functions to match your OutcomeHandlers declaration e.g.

            	
            	
bananaHandler = function()
            	
{
            		
	alert("banana");
            	
}
            	
            	



Place these right at the start of the script section 

NOTE
====

You can override the default AutoClose or ForcePrint methods by re-implementing the functions e.g.

<script>
        
var bananaHandler = function()
        
{
        	
alert("banana");
        
};
                
        

var manywho = {
            
cdnUrl: 'https://assets.manywho.com',
            
requires: ['core', 'bootstrap3'],


Add the custom attributes to the outcome - they will stack.
